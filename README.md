Hi there! I'm a full-stack developer with a love for creating efficient and scalable web apps. As a lifelong learner, I'm always looking for new ways to grow my skills and knowledge in the field.

I'm committed to staying up-to-date with the latest development trends and best practices, and I'm open to new challenges and collaborations. My go-to tech stack includes MySQL, JavaScript (Node JS), Express, Nest JS, and React. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or ideas you'd like to discuss. Looking forward to connecting with you!
